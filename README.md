An Android project for a slot booking.

At the start of this APP. A Register and Login button is provided.
A new user can register to access the system.
Regular users can use the credentials to enter the system.

Here I have used SQLite database for authentication and authorization. An unauthorized user is forced to register or quit from using this APP.
An unauthorized user is taken to a page specifying the user is unauthorized to enter the system.

After entering the system a calender is present. Select the date in the calender and click the 'Date' button. A toast message will  pop up specifying the date seleceted.
On next page the slot that is available is present. select the slot and click on 'Time' Button. A toast messsage will pop up specifying the slot selected.
Click on 'Thank You'Button to move out of the system.
